Instructions:
First, the implement is include CWRU、SEU、XJTU、JNU、MFPT、UoC、DC all 7 public fault datasets.
Secondly, in order to compare the effects of different parameters on the experiment more conveniently, almost every parameter is optional，and these changeable parameters include dataset, sampling method, graph structure type, network model, noise, input type, number of nodes, etc. (see code for details).
Finally, you can choose to use confusion matrix and tsne to visualize all the results and the features of each layer of network respectively.

注：Please setting 图神经网络 as root source when you run code.
